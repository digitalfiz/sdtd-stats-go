## This is a library to get stats about your 7 days to die server.

This is an attempt to make a library for the API that Alloc is making via his 
fixes at https://7dtd.illy.bz/wiki. 

This library requires your 7 Days to die server to have Alloc's fixes installed 
and working.

You also have to add a web token in gamedir/Saves/webpermissions.xml for the lib to use.


## Things that don't seem to be implimented so I didnt make methods for them:
- GetLog
- ExecuteConsoleCommand
